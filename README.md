This is a project to solve a real problem in the world of occupancy metrics in a smart office building.

A lot of businesses need to discover the utilisation of the rooms of the smart building(s) they lease off.

This project suggests and implements a solution for this professional problem by collecting real-time data from sensors (another project of mine) and then displaying this data in customisable dashboards.
